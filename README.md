## 1. Study Protocol

For the complete explanation on the methodology of our study, including the formulae for extracting image features and the normalization of feature values, please consult the [manuscript](preprint.pdf).

1. We selected 654 UML class diagrams from [the Lindholmen dataset](http://www.models-db.com/) that satisfies our criteria.
2. We had six experts manually inspecting and labeling the layout quality of the diagrams. Each diagram was rated by two experts in the scale of 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). The final quality label of a diagram is the average of the two rating points.
3. We extracted features for machine learning from the 654 diagrams using computer vision based on [prior work](https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2014.65) and filtered out diagrams that our image processor could not handle. This leaves a final dataset of 609 images.
4. We fed the dataset (and a normalized version of the dataset) to various machine learning algorithms using the [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/) tool, selected the best performing algorithm, and performed grid search on the algorithm's parameters using `python` with the `scikit-learn` module to find a better-performing model.
5. We evaluated the performance of our models.
